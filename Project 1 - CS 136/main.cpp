//Write a function that accept a linked list of integers and reverses the
//order of the linked list nodes. The function should have one parameter
//which is a pointer to the head of the list. After the function is called, this
//pointer will point to the head of a linked list that has the same nodes as
//the original list, but in the reverse of the order they had in the original list.
//Your function should not create or destroy any nodes. It should only rearrange nodes.
//Write a test program to test your function.
//..............................................................................
//What you need to submit is:
//
//1- Pseudocode of your function. Can be added as a comment in your source code file.
//1- Your program source code files (e.g., .cpp extension file).
//2- Screenshots of your test program output (.png or jpeg file)
//3- (optionally) you can include the executable file (e.g., .exe file)//
